  <h1>Privacy Policy for Gaming Hub</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [April 30, 2025]</p>

  <p>Gaming Hub (“we”, “us” or “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application TikGame, available on the Samsung Galaxy Store.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do <em>Not</em> Collect</h2>

  <h2>2. Information We <em>Do</em> Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect non-personal information about how you interact with the app, including your device type, operating system version, game session length, levels played, and in-game events.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> We may collect your device’s advertising identifier (e.g. Google Advertising ID or equivalent) for the purpose of serving personalized ads via our ad partners.</li>
  </ul>
